  <h3><a href="https://github.com/hombred118/QA-Tripleten-Sprint1" target="_blank">Development and testing of Urban Routes</a></h3>
  <p>In this sprint, regression testing was performed on the Urban Routes application.
The app allows users to set origin and destination addresses, then calculates routes and prices using a specific algorithm.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/hombred118/QA-Tripleten-Sprint2" target="_blank">Test Design</a></h3>
  <p>Urban Routes is a transportation application that generates routes and calculates trip duration and costs.

In this project, I focused on requirement analysis and test design, applying different QA techniques to ensure coverage and identify potential gaps ("gray areas").

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/hombred118/QA-Tripleten-Sprint3" target="_blank">Web Application Testing</a></h3>
  <p>During this project, I learned and applied:

 How a web application works.
 How to test interface elements.
 How to test web applications across different devices and browsers.
 How to test design adaptability.
 How to design effective test cases for web apps.
 How to use Chrome DevTools for debugging, responsive view testing, and inspecting elements.

Testing was conducted in two environments:

Google Chrome, 800x600 resolution
Firefox, 1920x1080 resolution</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/hombred118/QA-Tripleten-Sprint4" target="_blank">API Testing</a></h3>
  <p>During this project, I learned and applied:

 Fundamentals of HTTP structure (methods, headers, status codes).
 Reading and interpreting API documentation (apiDoc).
 Working with JSON format for requests and responses.
 Understanding REST architecture and endpoints.
 Designing test techniques for API validation (positive, negative, boundary cases).
 Using Postman to create and send API requests, collections, and assertions.
 Writing bug reports in Jira for failed cases.

The testing scope included new features in the Urban.Grocers API:

Kits Management – Ability to add groceries to a kit using:

POST /api/v1/kits/{id}/products
Expected: return 400 Bad Request when the resulting product list length > 30 (regardless of quantities).
Delivery Services – Ability to check availability and price of the "Order and Go" delivery service using:

POST /order-and-go/v1/delivery
Based on delivery calculation rules in the requirements.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/hombred118/QA-Tripleten-Sprint5" target="_blank">Mobile Application Testing</a></h3>
  <p>This project focused on testing the Urban.Lunch Android mobile application using both an emulator and real devices.

Key learning areas included:

 Installing and configuring Android Studio for mobile emulation.
 Installing and running Android apps on emulators and real devices.
 Understanding the specifics of mobile app testing (UI, performance, device compatibility).
 Reporting bugs and linking them to failed test cases in Jira.

Scope of Testing:

Analyze app requirements for Urban.Lunch.
Design a checklist to validate core functionality (selected bolded requirements).
Execute tests on both Android Studio Emulator and real Android device.
Record results as PASSED or FAILED.
Create bug reports in Jira for failed tests and attach links to the results table.
Draft a Test Report summarizing the tested product state.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/hombred118/QA-Tripleten-Sprint6" target="_blank">Log Analysis and SQL/DataBase Testing</a></h3>
  <p>This project consisted of two parts:

1. Log Analysis via Command Line

Work on a remote Linux server through SSH.
Search logs for specific errors (400, 500) and IP addresses.
Filter and organize logs into structured directories and files.

2. Database Testing (PostgreSQL)

Connect to a PostgreSQL database (chicago_taxi).
Run SQL queries to validate data integrity and business logic.
Analyze relationships between multiple tables (cabs, trips, neighborhoods, weather_records).
Verify hypotheses about data consistency and system bugs.</p>
